# rocq-word

Yet another machine word library in Rocq.
Defines arithmetic operations directly by recursion on the structure of the word vectors rather than through conversion to integers.
You probably shouldn't use this one if you care about performance of extracted code.

## TODO
- Documentation
- Examples
- Dune build support
